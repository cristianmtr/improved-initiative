    "Description": [
      "The caster creates a mental contact with the planes, forces, powers, and geometries of the beyond, in order to gain affirmative or negative answers to the questions he contemplates. The spell’s effects depend upon how deeply into the caster quests into the various planes of existence. The caster must decide how “far” into the planes of existence he wishes to make contact. The number of planes in “depth” that he chooses will affect the number of yes or no questions he can ask, the chance that the knowledge is available at that level, the chance of receiving a wrong answer, and the chance that he will become temporarily insane from the experience. Temporary insanity lasts for as many weeks as the “number” of the plane where the caster’s sanity failed (or was deliberately removed)."

If anyone other than the caster reads the rune, the sigil explodes into fire, automatically dealing 4d6 points of damage to anyone directly in front of it. The parchment or book upon which the rune was scribed will also be destroyed. An explosive rune can be detected, bypassed, and even removed by a higher-level Magic-User. Any Magic-User at least two levels higher than the rune’s creator has a 60% chance to detect it, a 75% chance to bypass it (if it is detected), and a 100% chance to remove it (if it is successfully detected and bypassed)."

The Magic-User can return from the jar to his or her original body whenever desired, thus ending the spell.

It is not under the caster’s control, in the sense that it will not specifically target any individuals or affect one place within the radius more than any other place. Note that this spell is not by any means the only way in which groups of druids might exercise control over weather conditions using holy places or acting together in mystic rituals. It is simply the manner by which a lone (but powerful) Druid can summon forth weather conditions using no ritual beyond mere spell casting."
